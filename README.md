TORONTO - Segmentation and Clustering of Neighbourhoods

## 1- Project Description:

Let's take a city like the City of Toronto, you will segment it into separate neighborhoods using
the geographical coordinates of each neighborhood. Then, using a combination of location data
using Foursquare API and Artificial intelligent (clustering), you will group the neighborhoods
into clusters. You will learn the skills and the apps to use location data to explore a geographical
location. You will have the chance to be as creative as you want and come up with a new idea
to leverage the Foursquare API location data to explore neighborhoods of your choice or to
come up with an issue that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve. The main aspects
to consider is to determine the most common area in Toronto to a minimum of two of these
topics and find the correlation between them:

1. Crime rate (e.g. Assault, break and enter, homicide, and robbery)
2. Population information (e.g. Age, marital status, education, and income)
3. Income source and taxes.
